# cloudjob

A job platform built on top of the awesome serverless platform Cloudflare Workers!

## Demo

You can test the frontend of  Cloudjob [here.](https://cloudjob.vercel.app/), or host it yourselves on Cloudflare Workers and test the API.

## Why?

I wanted to learn more about serverless, and also get some portfolio projects, so what's better than doing a long time idea?

## Requirements

You must use [wrangler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/cli-wrangler/install-update) 1.17 or newer.
